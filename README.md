# 🎶 Customer Churn Prediction in Music Streaming Using XAI  

## 📌 Introduction  
In the competitive music streaming industry, retaining users is critical for business growth. This project leverages **Explainable AI (XAI)** to analyze customer churn, offering transparency in predictions and actionable insights to improve retention strategies.

## 🚀 Project Overview  
**Objective:** Predict and analyze customer churn in a music streaming platform using AI-driven techniques while ensuring model interpretability through XAI.

### 🎯 Key Goals  
- 🔍 **Identify Churn Drivers:** Uncover key factors leading to user drop-off with XAI.  
- 📈 **Optimize Retention Strategies:** Provide data-driven insights to enhance user engagement.  
- 💡 **Enhance User Experience:** Use model explanations to improve customer satisfaction.  

## ⚙ Project Setup  
### 📝 Problem Statement  
- **Customer Churn Impact:** High churn rates lead to revenue loss and increased acquisition costs.  
- **Engagement Decline:** Proactively identifying disengaged users can reduce attrition.  

### 💡 Solution Approach  
1. **Data Processing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and dataset balancing.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Extract insights from user behavior trends.  
3. **Model Development:** Train and evaluate machine learning models.  
4. **Optimization:** Fine-tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.  
5. **Explainability:** Use **SHAP** and **LIME** for model transparency.
