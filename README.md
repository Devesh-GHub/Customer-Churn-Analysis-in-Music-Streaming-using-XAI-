 Customer Churn Prediction in Music Streaming Using XAI

📌 Introduction

In the fast-paced music streaming industry, customer retention is key to long-term success. This project leverages Explainable AI (XAI) to analyze customer churn, providing transparency in predictions and actionable insights for reducing user attrition. By understanding why users leave, businesses can implement effective strategies to enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

🚀 Project Overview

Objective: Predict and analyze customer churn in a music streaming platform using AI-driven techniques while ensuring explainability through XAI.

🎯 Key Goals

🔍 Identify Churn Drivers: Pinpoint key factors leading to user drop-off using XAI techniques.

📈 Enhance Retention Strategies: Provide insights to design proactive customer engagement tactics.

💡 Improve User Experience: Utilize explainable models to understand and address customer concerns.

⚙ Project Setup

📝 Problem Definition

High Customer Churn: Unchecked attrition results in revenue loss and increased customer acquisition costs.

Reduced Engagement: Identifying disengaged users early allows businesses to take preventive measures.

💡 Proposed Approach

Data Processing: Handle missing values, manage outliers, and balance the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into customer behavior and trends.

Model Development: Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.

Optimization: Fine-tune hyperparameters for improved performance.

Explainability with XAI: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for model interpretability.
